# Hello World! 🌍

I'm undergratuated mathematics student at a Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) at Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Since 2024 i'm self-learning Data Science to do projects, own my first job as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst and participate in Competitions at Kaggle, btw. 

I'm constantly learning maths, statistics and programming to search the best solutions for my work.
